# ML_glass-identification
Building a classifier for glass using Machine Learning

# Data
For this project, the dataset from: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/glass+identification was used.
This dataset provides 214 entries, each entry contains type of glass, refractive index and reperesentaions of chemical composition (in a form of weight percent in corresponding oxide).  

# Aim
The aim of the project was to build a classifier, which could predict the type of glass using refractive index and chemical composition data.
